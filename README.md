# Data-Assessment

MyHomes Real Estate Company Database
=====================================
This repository contains the database implementation for the MyHomes Real Estate Company. The objective of this project is to design and implement an information system using SQL to support the operations of the company. The system will handle various aspects such as managing properties, sales representatives, customers, areas, and supervisors.

Objective
==========
The objective of this individual assessment is to build a database based on the learning outcome of SQL. The scenario for this project is the MyHomes Real Estate Company, which operates globally in the buying and selling of properties. The company deals with five types of properties: houses, flats/apartments, bungalows, land, and commercial property. Each property is assigned to a specific sales representative who is responsible for its management. Some representatives also act as supervisors, overseeing a team of fellow representatives. Additionally, representatives may interact with customers, who are assigned to them exclusively. Sales representatives are also associated with geographical sales areas, and there is always a chief salesperson for each area who reports to management regarding sales performance.

Tasks of the Assessment
========================
The assessment consists of two main parts:

Part 1: Database Design
-----------------------
In this part, you will design the database schema for the MyHomes company. You are required to use a relational model and normalization approach of your choice to produce the following designs:

1. Conceptual Design: A high-level representation of the database structure, capturing the main entities and their relationships.
2. Logical Design: A detailed representation of the database structure, including tables, attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys.
3. Physical Design: The implementation-specific details, such as data types, indexes, and any other necessary considerations for performance and storage optimization.

Part 2: Database Implementation
-------------------------------
Building upon the design from Part 1, you will implement the database for the MyHomes scenario. This part involves the following tasks:

1. Populating the Database: Inserting sample data into the tables to create a realistic dataset.
2. Answering Queries: Writing SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the database. This includes displaying representative details, property details, supervisor names, customer details, area details, and manager names.
